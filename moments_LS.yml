# Moments used for Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) Estimation

# Setup Section
# Define the basic setup for the analysis including derived variables, 
# time indices, member identifiers, and age groups.

# Data must appear as .csv in the following format:
# ID, year, age, treatment, gender, var1, var2, var3, var4,....
# Identified variables can be labelled below under 'set-up'

Setup:
  estimation_name:
    - "Demonstration_1"  # Name of the estimation for tracking purposes.

  # Derived Variables
  # Define any new variables calculated from existing ones.
  derived_variables:
    - 'None'

  # Time Indices
  # Specify the time periods that will be used in the analysis.
  # Use the format as it appears in the data-set (e.g., 2004/2005).
  time_indices:
    - [2010, 2014]

  # Member ID Variable
  # Column name for member identifiers as they appear in the data-set.
  ID_var:
    - 'index'

  # Time Variable
  # Column name for time identifiers as they appear in the data-set.
  # If left blank, then data is not time-series. 
  time_var:
    - 'year'

  # Age Variable
  # Column name for the age variable. If None, then age is not a dimension 
  # for the analysis (e.g. Female Presidents)
  age_var:
    - 'Age'
  
  # Treatment Variable
  # Column name for the treatment group variable. If None, then treatment 
  # is not a dimension. 
  # Treatment groups specify groups from different RCT treatment groups e.g. 
  # control (0), treatment type 1 (1), treatment type 2 (2), etc.
  treat_var: 
    - None 

  # Gender Variable 
  gender_var:
    - 'Gender' 

  # Cohort Groups
  # Define the cohort groups used with specific age ranges.
  age_groups:
    20-30:
      - true   # Include the minimum age.
      - 20     # Minimum age.
      - 30     # Maximum age.
      - false  # Exclude the maximum age.
    30-40:
      - true   # Include the minimum age.
      - 30     # Minimum age.
      - 40     # Maximum age. 
      - false  # Exclude the maximum age.
    40-50:
      - true   # Include the minimum age.
      - 40     # Minimum age.
      - 50     # Maximum age. 
      - false  # Exclude the maximum age.
    50-60:
      - true   # Include the minimum age.
      - 50     # Minimum age.
      - 60     # Maximum age. 
      - false  # Exclude the maximum age.


# Identification Section
# Specify the variables used to construct the moment conditions used in the SMM,
# such as means, standard deviations,
# correlations, and autocorrelations. Derived variables from above 
# can also be used here.
#
# The default is to generate moment conditions by time, age, gender, cohort
# and treatment group. If the data is a time-series, then autocorrelations
# are also generated with a one time-period lag as per the list "time_indices"

Identification:
  # Mean
  mean:
    - wealth_fin
    - wealth_real
    - mortgagebal

  # Standard Deviations

  sds:
    - wealth_fin
    - wealth_real
    - mortgagebal
  # Correlations
  # Pairs of variables. Correlations are calculated in the cross-section. 
  corrs:
    - [wealth_fin, wealth_real]
    - [mortgagebal, wealth_real]

  # Autocorrelations
  # Autocorrelations are calculated across consecutive time periods.
  # Autocorrelations are calculated only if there are multiple time periods specified.
  autocorrs:
    - wealth_fin
