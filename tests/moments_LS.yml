# Config file for generating moments used in Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) Estimation
# Data format: .csv with columns - ID, year, age, treatment, gender, var1, var2, var3, var4, ...
# 'Identifier' variables are specified under 'Setup'

# Setup Section
# Define 'identifier' variables: ID, time indices, age, treatment, and gender
# Define age groups for splitting moments and any new variables for the identification strategy

Setup:
  estimation_name:
    - "Demonstration_1"  # Name for tracking purposes

  # Derived Variables
  # Define new variables calculated from existing data
  derived_variables:
    - total_wealth = wealth_fin + wealth_real

  # Time Indices
  # Specify time periods used in the analysis
  time_indices:
    - [2010, 2014]

  # Member ID Variable
  # Column name for member identifiers in the data-set
  ID_var:
    - 'member_id'

  # Time Variable
  # Column name for time identifiers in the data-set
  time_var:
    - 'year'

  # Age Variable
  # Column name for the age variable
  age_var:
    - 'age'

  # Treatment Variable
  # Column name for treatment group variable
  treat_var:
    - None

  # Gender Variable
  gender_var:
    - 'gender'

  # Age Groups
  # Define age groups for analysis
  age_groups:
    20-30:
      - include_min: true
      - min_age: 20
      - max_age: 30
      - include_max: false
    30-40:

    40-50:
      - include_min: true
      - min_age: 40
      - max_age: 50
      - include_max: false
    50-60:

      - max_age: 60
      - include_max: false

# Identification Section
# Specify variables for constructing moment conditions in SMM
# Includes means, standard deviations, correlations, and autocorrelations
# Derived variables are also applicable

Identification:
  # Mean
  mean:
    - wealth_fin
    - wealth_real
    - mortgagebal
    - total_wealth

  # Standard Deviations
  sds:
    - wealth_fin
    - wealth_real
    - mortgagebal
    - total_wealth

  # Correlations
  # Pairs of variables for cross-sectional correlations
  corrs:
    - [wealth_fin, wealth_real]
    - [mortgagebal, wealth_real]

  # Autocorrelations
  # Calculated across consecutive time periods if multiple periods are specified
  autocorrs:
